# Azure Machine Learning Workspace Creation

This repository demonstrates four different methods to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace:

1. **Azure Portal**: This method involves using the Azure Portal web interface to create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace. Detailed step-by-step instructions are provided in the [Azure Portal Method](./portal/instructions.md) guide.

2. **Azure CLI**: The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace using command-line commands. Refer to the [Azure CLI Method](./cli/instructions.md) guide for detailed instructions.

3. **Azure Python SDK**: The Azure Python SDK provides a powerful way to programmatically create an Azure Machine Learning workspace using Python code. Check out the [Azure Python SDK Method](./sdk/instructions.md) guide for code examples and instructions.

4. **ARM Templates**: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates enable you to define and deploy Azure resources, including an Azure Machine Learning workspace, using declarative JSON templates. The [ARM template](./arm/template.json) is shown only as an example but it is possible to create a workspace from it. [Here is how you could do it](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-create-first-template?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=MVP_340422#create-your-first-template).

Choose the method that suits your needs and follow the respective guide to create your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
